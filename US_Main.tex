\subsection{Centrality measures}

\subsubsection{Degree centrality} 

The degree of a node is the number of edges that node is connected with \citep{arcaute_networks_2023}. Hence, the degree centrality measure account for the number of edges a node is connected to. The higher the value, the higher number of edges (links) are connected to that node. Although simple, the degree centrality comes as a valuable reference when assessing networks \citep{newman_networks_2018}. The degree centrality measure $d$ for node $i$ is defined as 

\[D_{i} = \frac{v}{n-1}\]

where $v$ is the number of edges connected to node $i$ and $n$ is number of nodes in the network. It represents the faction of nodes that node $i$ is connected to, as $n-1$ is the number of possible connections of node $i$ in the network \citep{hagberg_exploring_2008}.

In the underground network context, the degree of a station would represent the number of  stations that the station of interest is connected with. Then, the degree centrality of a  station would measure the number of connections of a stations to other stations in the underground. Thus, this measure reflects the level of connectivity of a underground station when just considering the number of connections to other stations.

\subsubsection{Closeness centrality}

The closeness centrality measures accounts for how close in term of distance is a node to other nodes in a network.

Let $d_{ij}$ be the geodesic distance (shortest path) between node $i$ and $j$. The mean geodesic distance $l$ of a node $i$ to other nodes in a network is given by
    
\[l_{i}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j} d_{ij}\]
    
where $n$ is the total number of nodes of the network. Thus, the closeness centrality measure is the inverse of the mean geodesic distance $l_{i}$ and defined as

\[C_{i}= \frac{1}{l_{i}} = \frac{n}{\sum_{j} d_{ij}}\]

The closeness centrality measure applied to the underground network would result in the

% Simply use the section and subsection commands, as in this example document! With Overleaf, all the formatting and numbering is handled automatically according to the template you've chosen. If you're using Rich Text mode, you can also create new section and subsections via the buttons in the editor toolbar.

% \subsection{How to include Figures}

% First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link in the file-tree menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

% Note that your figure will automatically be placed in the most appropriate place for it, given the surrounding text and taking into account other figures or tables that may be close by. You can find out more about adding images to your documents in this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Including_images_on_Overleaf}{including images on Overleaf}.

% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
% \caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded via the file-tree menu.}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{How to add Tables}

% Use the table and tabular environments for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. For more information, please see this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/tables}{tables}. 

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{l|r}
% Item & Quantity \\\hline
% Widgets & 42 \\
% Gadgets & 13
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{How to add Comments and Track Changes}

% Comments can be added to your project by highlighting some text and clicking ``Add comment'' in the top right of the editor pane. To view existing comments, click on the Review menu in the toolbar above. To reply to a comment, click on the Reply button in the lower right corner of the comment. You can close the Review pane by clicking its name on the toolbar when you're done reviewing for the time being.

% Track changes are available on all our \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{premium plans}, and can be toggled on or off using the option at the top of the Review pane. Track changes allow you to keep track of every change made to the document, along with the person making the change. 

% \subsection{How to add Lists}

% You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{enumerate}
% \dots or bullet points \dots
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{How to write Mathematics}

% \LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
% \[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
%       = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
% denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


% \subsection{How to change the margins and paper size}

% Usually the template you're using will have the page margins and paper size set correctly for that use-case. For example, if you're using a journal article template provided by the journal publisher, that template will be formatted according to their requirements. In these cases, it's best not to alter the margins directly.

% If however you're using a more general template, such as this one, and would like to alter the margins, a common way to do so is via the geometry package. You can find the geometry package loaded in the preamble at the top of this example file, and if you'd like to learn more about how to adjust the settings, please visit this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/page_size_and_margins}{page size and margins}.

% \subsection{How to change the document language and spell check settings}

% Overleaf supports many different languages, including multiple different languages within one document. 

% To configure the document language, simply edit the option provided to the babel package in the preamble at the top of this example project. To learn more about the different options, please visit this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/International_language_support}{international language support}.

% To change the spell check language, simply open the Overleaf menu at the top left of the editor window, scroll down to the spell check setting, and adjust accordingly.

% \subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

% You can simply upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with a tool such as JabRef. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{arcaute_networks_2023}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|. You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

% If you have an \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{upgraded account}, you can also import your Mendeley or Zotero library directly as a \verb|.bib| file, via the upload menu in the file-tree.
